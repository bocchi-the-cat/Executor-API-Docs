## No Longer Working & Archive Missing
### Let us know if you have, find or get a working archive of any of these sites
#### That also applies to the Sites listed above with the `Archived` Tag as the archived version might not cover the full website hence why a proper & working version that we can host here instead is appreciated.

* [Here's Full List of Executors](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/blob/master/Full-Executor-List), it can be used to search for **missing** documentations. To increase your chances of finding missing docs you can also try adding any combination of the following keywords: `documentation` / `docs` / `exploit` / `executor` / `roblox` / `sploit`. Likewise, if you think the list is missing some name(s) let us know by opening a a [Pull Request](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/issues). Good luck with your search!<br />

* [Here's Guide for Restoring Websites](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Restoring), if you manage to fully restore a website from the list below you should open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/pulls) to this repository with the website that you've restored, or you can just open an [Issue](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/issues). This way we can ensure websites are safe & sound. This also allows us (you included) to make edits & fixes to the websites if we need to!

* We recommend using `https://web.archive.org/web/*/example.com` for ***Snapshot Calendar*** and `https://web.archive.org/web/*/example.com/*` for ***URL Table List***, make sure to replace `example.com` with the website domain that you're looking to inspect (without `https://`). This site (https://archivarix.com/en/) should format the links automatically for you after you enter your desired domain into the domain textbox:
<br /><br />![Example](https://github.com/luau/Executor-API-Docs/assets/95628489/6e588d90-cb58-4f44-990e-083ceeecb784)

Another approach is to use the Web Archive api directly, example: `https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=*.krampus.gg/`. This way you can inspect all the domains & subdomains that were archived.

Also, you can use this site https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse which archives all sort of code.
